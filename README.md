# hello-world

1. The original, canonical github repository is maintained by the Axodyne account. Only Axodyne is able to write changes to this account.

2. Axodyne works away on the repo. Changes are made, commits are added.

3. In the early days, changes are made directly into the ```main``` branch and pushed up to the github repo as needed.

4. Normally, a meaningful commit message would be used but in this early state, the messages are numbered to correspond with these paragraph numbers.

5. The result is a nice, simple linear sequence of commits that everyone can follow.
