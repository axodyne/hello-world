# hello-world

1. The original, canonical github repository is maintained by the Axodyne account. Only Axodyne is able to write changes to this account.

2. Axodyne works away on the repo. Changes are made, commits are added.

3. In the early days, changes are made directly into the ```main``` branch and pushed up to the github repo as needed.
