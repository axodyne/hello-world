# Merging with a Modified Main Branch

It is pretty clen and simple whena repo maintainer is working on a single ```main``` branch and wants to simply add commits.

Even if feature or topicbranches are involved, this remain simple so long as the main branch is not modified while the feature or topic is being worked on.

1. Things can proceed as before. Changes are made and committed.

2. Slowly, it dawns on our maintainer that a new topic is needed.

3. She creates a new ```topic``` branch immediately after committing this change.
