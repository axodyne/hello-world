# Merging with a Modified Main Branch

It is pretty clen and simple whena repo maintainer is working on a single ```main``` branch and wants to simply add commits.

Even if feature or topicbranches are involved, this remain simple so long as the main branch is not modified while the feature or topic is being worked on.

1. Things can proceed as before. Changes are made and committed.

2. Slowly, it dawns on our maintainer that a new topic is needed.

3. She creates a new ```topic``` branch immediately after committing this change.

4. Having worked a little on the topic-one document, axodyne returnsat this point tomake some changes in the ```main``` branch.

5. These changes are in a different document to those made in the ```topic``` branch and so there are unlikely to be any conflicts.
