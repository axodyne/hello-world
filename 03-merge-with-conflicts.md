# Merging with conflicts

Happy now with basic development, axodyne knows how to make changes to the ```main``` branch and commit them. She is also persuaded that it is better create working branches for development, make the changes there and then merge them in to ```main`` when ready - even if main has changed in the meantime.

There may come a time when changes are made to files in both ```main``` and a working branch - call it ```develop``` for now. Why and how, this can happen is not so important. For now, concentrate on what t do about it when it does happen. Suppose a new file is needed - call it ```conflicted-topic.md```. The file is created, some content added and the ```main``` branch committed and brought up to date.

After some content is added to the new file, axodyne creates a branch to continue work with it.

Now the ```conflicted-topic``` branch has been created and some work is done in it and committed.
